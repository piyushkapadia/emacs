In order to install Source Code Pro, you can:

Go to Google Fonts
Type source code in the search box (the only match should be Source Code Pro)
Click "Add to collection"
Click on the text sample (this should present all the font styles)
Tick all the check boxes
Click the download icon (a down arrow on the top right) and download as Zip file
Now you just need to decompress the Zip file into your ~/.fonts folder:

mkdir -p ~/.fonts/Source_Code_Pro
unzip Source_Code_Pro.zip  -d ~/.fonts/Source_Code_Pro
You may need to run

fc-cache -f
to make the fonts available (no need to log out).
